### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- We built a webpage that generates random book covers based off of arrays of various titles, pictures, and descriptors. It also allows you to create your own cover and save your favorite covers. The app is solving the problem of authors not having a way to procure a cover for their book. Authors would be able to generate covers for their books when using this app.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- Fork this finished repository. Clone down new,forked repo. cd into the repository. Run open index.html to access the webpage. Open your text editor. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
- This project was assigned on a Tuesday afternoon and was due that Sunday evening. This project took us about 30 hours to complete. We made sure to take breaks as necessary during the process to prevent unproductive struggle. This was completed during our second week at Turing.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
- This was a paired partner project completed by Isaiah Richardson and Kelli Watkins. Links to our GitHubs are listed below.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- The learning goals for this project were to write clean, dry JavaScript; explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; write code collaboratively; learn how to ask questions correctly; practice proper workflow for GitHub
- We used Dev Tools, VS Code, GitHub, Notion for note taking and it was completed on MacBook Pro (MacOS Monterrey) laptops.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- We learned how to read HTML more effectively and how the sections work together.
- We learned how to integrate HTML through JavaScript.
- We learned the importance of understanding the GitHub workflow and how vital it is to being able to complete paired/group projects efficiently. 
- A few challenges we faced were time management, merge conflicts in GitHub, how to implement new methods, how to research unfamiliar topics.
